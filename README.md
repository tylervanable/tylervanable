Hello all! My name is Tyler, and I am a student at CCRI! I'm interested in Python as an automation tool. I'm also interested in web development.

I'm an avid video game enthusiast and want to learn game development through Pygame. 

While I prefer not to upload a profile picture, please look through my repositories for educational content and elementary Python programs!
