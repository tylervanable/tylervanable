Hello all! 👋 My name is Tyler, and I am a student at CCRI! I'm interested in Python as an automation tool. I'm also interested in web development, AI, and cybersecurity.

I'm an avid video game enthusiast and want to learn game development with Pygame.

While I prefer not to upload a profile picture, please look through my repositories for educational content and elementary Python programs! 

* ⛏️ I'm currently working on this page. I'm also working on a project called "EduSelf" and compiling elementary Python projects as a repository.
* 🌱 I'm currently learning Python at CCRI.
* 💭 Ambitions: educational software development, AI development.
* 😎 Fun fact: I love listening to music! I can play a little bit of each instrument.
