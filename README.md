💫 **About Me**:  

Hello all! My name is Tyler, and I am a student! I'm interested in using Python as an automation tool. I'm also interested in web development, AI/machine learning, and Linux!

I'm an avid video game enthusiast and want to learn game development with Pygame.

* ⛏️ I'm consistently updating this page as I become more proficient with different programming languages and my interests develop. 
* 🧐 I have past research experience using Rstudio. 
* 🌱 I'm currently learning Python. Feel free to study scripts in my python_projects respository if you are learning Python! 
* 🔎 I'm compiling OOP Python projects into a repository, including classes, methods, inheritance, etc.
* 📑 I'm also compiling code samples and Markdown notes for various Python modules, such as tkinter, typing, logging, os, etc. 
* ☕️ I'm learning Java - in the coming months, I will upload scripts isolating the syntax of Java variables, types, IPO structures, branches, repetition, methods, classes, and arrays
* 💭 Ambitions: educational software development, AI/machine learning software development, video game development
* 😎 Fun fact: I love listening to music! I can play a little bit of most instruments.
Thank you very much for your time! Please feel free to look through my repositories for educational content and elementary Python programs!
