💫 **About Me**:  

Hello all! My name is Tyler, and I am a student! I'm interested in using Python as an automation tool. I'm also interested in web development, AI/machine learning, and cybersecurity.

I'm an avid video game enthusiast and want to learn game development with Pygame.

* ⛏️ I'm consistently updating this page as I become more proficient with different programming languages and my interests develop. 
* 🧐 I have past research experience using Rstudio. 
* 🌱 I'm currently learning Python. I'm spending time learning list/dictionary methods, OOP, and different modules such as tkinter. 
* 🔎 I'm also compiling introductory Python projects into a repository 
* 💭 Ambitions: educational software development, AI/machine learning development, video game development.
* 😎 Fun fact: I love listening to music! I can play a little bit of most instruments.
Thank you very much for your time! Please feel free to look through my repositories for educational content and elementary Python programs!
