💫 **About Me**: 

Hello all! My name is Tyler, and I am a student! I'm interested in using Python as an automation tool. I'm also interested in web development, AI, and cybersecurity. I have past research experience using Rstudio. 

I'm an avid video game enthusiast and want to learn game development with Pygame.

* ⛏️ I'm consistently updating this page as I become more proficient with different programming languages and my interests develop. 
* 🔎 I'm working on a project called "EduSelf".
* 🔎 I'm also compiling introductory Python projects into a repository as I learn and reinforce programming fundamentals such as data types, branching, loops, functions, and data structures. 
* 🌱 I'm currently learning Python.
* 💭 Ambitions: educational software development, AI development, video game development.
* 😎 Fun fact: I love listening to music! I can play a little bit of each instrument.

Thank you very much for your time! Please feel free to look through my repositories for educational content and elementary Python programs!
